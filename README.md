# 2015 Resolutions
My list of resolutions for 2015

## What is this all about?
I think [Orta][orta] inspired me to start using [:octocat:][github] more out of the :package: (kind of how he uses it for his new N.Y. apartment, or his traveling plans, etc).

I've been slacking on ~~some~~ (ok; I admit it; **A LOT**) of my resolutions and I think that writing them down and putting them out there in the :globe_with_meridians: for the public :eyes: might help be accomplish them.

Without further ado; here's my 

### List of resolutions for :two::zero::one::five::
- [ ] **Write more on my blog**: let's quantify this and say that I will write at least :keycap_ten: blog post by the end of 2015
- [ ] **Contribute more to OSS**: I would like to at least achieve 500 contributions by the end of the year
- [ ] **Release at least one personal project**: This is going to be tricky; lots of projects but I should commit to at least one
- [x] **Submit a talk to one conference**: Don't want to aim for a specific conference; just want to submit one talk; not even commiting to give a talk at a conference but at least submit to one
- [ ] **Organize a [`CocoaHeads`][cocoaheads] meetup in Costa Rica**: Long overdue but about time to start moving the local community of developers
- [ ] **Dive head first on a `Swift` project**: Been neglecting this one; kind of played with it a little bit but haven't actually commited to finishing a full real project on `Swift`
- [ ] **Finish learning `Haskell`**: This is kind of a broad one; I'll settle with at least finishing [Learn You a _Haskell_ for Great Good!][haskell]
- [ ] **Get back on the exercising train**: Kind of neglected this for the past 3 months and I was really close to my goal; putting a number I'll say **Reach 12% body fat** would be a good resolution.
